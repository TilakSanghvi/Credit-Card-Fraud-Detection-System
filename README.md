# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project builds a credit card fraud detection model using logistic regression. It employs under-sampling to balance the class distribution and evaluates the model's accuracy on both training and testing datasets.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - scikit-learn
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Implements logistic regression for fraud detection.
- **Class Balancing**: Uses under-sampling to handle class imbalance in the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model accuracy with metrics on training and testing datasets.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes visualizations to understand data distribution and model performance.
